# Consignment Shop

An ASP.NET C# Web Application.

Consignment Shop that uses Datasource to bind objects to controls and StateView to repopulate the shopping cart listbox on each postback to the server so that it isn't cleared. Since this is a consignment shop, only one of each item can be added to the shopping cart.

The solution contains two projects: ConsignmentShopFront and ConsignmentShopLibrary.
ConsignmentShopFront is the front end, and ConsignmentShopLibrary is the back end.

The repository contains two versions; one with sql (products are stored on a Mysql server), and a clean version without sql.
